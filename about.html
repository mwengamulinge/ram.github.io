                    Hello, I am a front end web developer with some experience. 
                    I've been programming for almost three years now. 
                    I have knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
                    I am also knowledgeable with web technologies like apache and mySQL. <br> 
                    I'm a driven guy that always seeks to broaden my knowledge and develop my abilities. 
                    I like to collaborate on projects with people and I am a good team player. 
                    I am a quick learner and am always prepared to assist. 
                    I'm open to new possibilities and eager to advance my web developer career.
